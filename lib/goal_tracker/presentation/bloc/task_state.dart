/// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// TaskState (Bloc State Definitions)
///
/// File purpose:
/// - Defines the various states used by the [TaskCubit] to manage
///   task lifecycle and UI rendering.
/// - Encapsulates loading, loaded, and error conditions in an immutable,
///   equatable structure for efficient Bloc rebuilds.
///
/// State overview:
/// - [TasksLoading]: Emitted while fetching or modifying task data.
/// - [TasksLoaded]: Emitted when tasks are successfully fetched;
///   contains a list of [Task] entities (optionally scoped by milestone or goal).
/// - [TasksError]: Emitted when an exception or data failure occurs.
///
/// Developer guidance:
/// - Always emit new immutable state instances.
/// - Keep states serializable-safe (no mutable or context-specific fields).
/// - When adding new states (e.g., for create/update success), extend
///   [TaskState] and override `props` for proper Equatable comparison.
