/*
 * File: ./lib/goal_tracker/domain/entities/habit.dart
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Domain representation of a Habit used throughout the application's
 *   business logic. Each Habit represents a recurring action that can
 *   contribute to milestone progress through completion tracking.
 *
 *   This file defines the plain, immutable domain entity and documents how
 *   it maps to persistence DTOs / Hive models (those mapper functions live
 *   in the data layer under `habit_model.dart`).
 *
 * Serialization rules (for implementers of DTO / Hive adapters):
 *   - `id` (String)           : non-nullable, globally unique identifier.
 *   - `name` (String)         : non-nullable, human-readable title.
 *   - `description` (String?) : nullable; empty vs null semantics managed by mappers.
 *   - `milestoneId` (String)  : non-nullable foreign key linking to parent Milestone.
 *   - `goalId` (String)       : non-nullable foreign key linking to parent Goal (auto-assigned from milestone).
 *   - `rrule` (String)        : non-nullable recurrence rule (RRULE format).
 *   - `targetCompletions` (int?): nullable; weight for milestone contribution (defaults to 1).
 *   - `isActive` (bool)       : non-nullable; whether habit is currently active (defaults to true).
 *
 * Compatibility guidance:
 *   - Do not reuse or renumber Hive field indices once written.
 *   - Any schema evolution (adding/removing fields) must be recorded in
 *     `migration_notes.md` with proper migration logic.
 *   - Mapper implementations (e.g., HabitModel.fromEntity()) are responsible
 *     for backward compatibility handling, such as missing numeric fields or
 *     default values.
 *
 * Notes for implementers:
 *   - This file should remain persistence-agnostic. Keep storage annotations
 *     and logic in the data layer only.
 *   - The domain layer operates with immutable, type-safe entities.
 *   - RRULE format should follow RFC 5545 standard for recurrence rules.
