// ./lib/goal_tracker/domain/usecases/create_goal.dart
/*
  purpose:
    - Encapsulates the "Create Goal" use case in the domain layer.
    - Defines a single, testable action responsible for adding a new [Goal] entity
      via the [GoalRepository] abstraction.
    - Keeps business rules and application logic independent of data storage or UI layers.

  usage:
    - Invoked by presentation or application services (e.g., Cubit, Bloc) when a new goal is created.
    - Accepts a [Goal] domain entity that is already validated or constructed via the UI.
    - Delegates persistence responsibility to the repository layer.

  compatibility guidance:
    - Do not inject data-layer classes directly here â€” always depend on [GoalRepository].
    - Keep this use case simple and composable with other domain operations.
    - If new creation rules (e.g., validation, default context assignment) are added,
      update README and domain guidelines accordingly.
