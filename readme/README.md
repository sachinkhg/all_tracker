# all_tracker

A comprehensive **Flutter** app for tracking progress and productivity — across both **personal goals** and **financial portfolios**.  
This repository includes mobile (Android & iOS) and web builds powered by Flutter.

---

## What this project is

**All Tracker** is a modular productivity and finance management platform built with **Flutter**, designed to unify personal goal tracking and portfolio management.

### Current & Planned Modules

- **Goal Tracker** — Complete goal, milestone, and task management system.  
  *(Status: ✅ Implemented)*  
  - Create and monitor personal or professional goals with hierarchical structure (Goal → Milestone → Task).  
  - Define milestones (time- or metric-based) within each goal.  
  - Add and manage tasks under each milestone with automatic goal assignment.  
  - Advanced filtering, sorting, and customizable view fields (title, description, target date, context, remaining days).  
  - Import/export functionality for goals, milestones, and tasks (CSV/Excel support).  
  - Persistent user preferences and view configurations using Hive storage.  
  - Clean architecture with domain-driven design (DDD) principles.

- **Portfolio Management** — Manage financial data across investments, liabilities, income, and expenses.  
  *(Status: To Do)*  
  - Track assets and liabilities.  
  - Categorize income and expenses.  
  - Analyze overall financial health with insights and reports.

- **More to add...**  
  Additional modules may include habit analytics, productivity metrics, and other life-tracking tools.
